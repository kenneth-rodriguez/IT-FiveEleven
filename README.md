# IT-FiveEleven
MSIT Course 511 - Object Oriented App. Development

A recipe tracking application written in Java, taking user inputs to populate a recipe list in the terminal.
This assignment was practice in creating reusable objects and constructors to create objects with arguments,
offering coherent and dynamic user instructions to do so.

After creating a new Recipe, the user is prompted to input an ingredient's name, unit of measurement, caloric
measurement per one (e.g. one egg, one cup of flour, etc.), how many of that ingredient is necessary for this
recipe, and the cost of one of these ingredients. The user is then prompted to continue adding ingredients,
cycling through and creating Ingredient objects to store in the Recipe's Ingredient ArrayList, until the
recipe is complete. After the user "exits" the loop, the recipe's name, ingredients, ingredient attributes,
and total cost is printed to the terminal.
